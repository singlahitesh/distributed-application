Submitting Metrics

There are multiple ways to send metrics to Datadog:

Via the Datadog Agent directly. Learn how to write an Agent check, or examine the Aggregator source code directly.
Via the DogStatsD server (bundled with the Datadog Agent) and a client library.
Directly via Datadog’s HTTP API.
Via Dropwizard’s Java metrics library with the metrics-datadog backend.

Naming metrics
There are a few rules regarding metric names:

Must start with a letter.
Must only contain ASCII alphanumerics, underscores, and periods.
Other characters, including spaces, are converted to underscores.
Unicode is not supported.
Must not exceed 200 characters. Fewer than 100 is preferred from a UI perspective.
Metrics reported by the Agent are in a pseudo-hierarchical dotted format
(e.g. http.nginx.response_time). The hierarchy is neither enforced nor interpreted,
but it can be used to infer things about servers (e.g. “hey, I see hostA and hostB are reporting http.nginx.*, those must be web frontends”).


In the Datadog web application there are five metric types (though one is deprecated):

COUNT
COUNTER (deprecated)
DISTRIBUTION
GAUGE
RATE
