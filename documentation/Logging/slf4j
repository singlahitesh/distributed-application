Difference between Slf4j anf log4j(or Logback) is same as difference between JPA and Hibernate

Application
Logging Code ----> SLF4J API---->Bridge---->Log4J2

SL4J does not provide a complete logging solution.
With SL4J, you cannot perform operations such as configuring appenders or setting logging levels.
You perform such configurations through a configuration file of the logging framework in use.
As the configuration file remains external to the application,
no dependencies exist between your application code and the underlying logging framework.

By default Spring Boot uses slf4j with logback.
